% Note on policy wording interpretation: I am reading the policy as saying that the condition is on the CDC ACIP's recommendation as to which infectious diseases be vaccinated against, not which vaccines be used
% Important Note: Not strictly necessary to check infectious_disease_for_which_cdc_acip_recommends_immunization, since we're only specifying coverages for immunizations for which the CDC ACIP recommends immunization, and each immunization is now split out into its own coverage
    % But keeping it for now, since it's a relevant condition and I think it should be included in explanations.
    % The infectious_disease_for_which_cdc_acip_recommends_immunization relation is defined in the respective immunization coverage files
    % Removed the claim.immunization_for_disease subgoal from covered_under_cardinal_care_24_25_benefit since we don't need to specify it on a per-claim basis anymore
